My process consisted of going over my prototype from UX and analyzing each color, font, and image. From there I decided how to code these elements, starting with my homepage, since it has the most content. I then added each page and began minor styling. Then I began implementing the mobile screen size and the responsiveness of the entire site. Some challenges I faced was trying to style the site to be exact to my prototype. This was hard since I had designed my wireframes for the prototype before knowing I would eventually be coding this in this class. However, I am happy with how similar my result is to the wireframe. Coding is not my strong suit, so it was reassuring knowing I could mostly replicate the prototype. A specific challenge I came across was trying to add the carousel from my prototype on my About page. After extensive research and testing, I was unable to accuarately code it, so I had to pivot and change that section a little bit. I overcame these challenges by researching, looking back on demos, and asking others if they encountered a similar issue. By creating my web portfolio, I have learned that coding is definitely not easy, at least for me. It takes a lot of time and it is better to start sooner than later, since the number of problems you may face can be unpredictable.

Also, it was super difficult to complete this assignment without receiving any feedback from my midterm until, literally, hours before this final was due. This was super frustrating and I was so unhappy to had to have waited over a month and a half for feedback that would have helped me in this assignment. Because of this, my confidence dropped and now I am completely unsure of how I will do in this final. I was not expecting to experience anything like this in this class, and I am super disappointed. Some of the marks I lost in my midterm were things I could have improved in this final, however, with 1 HOUR left to submit this (as of writing this), I am unable to change anything because of the extremely late feedback.
